# Compiling eBPF programs

An eBPF source code needs to be compiled into the machine instructions that the eBPF virtual machine can understand: eBPF bytecode.
The Clang compiler from the LLVM project will do this if you specify -target bpf.
The following is an extract from a Makefile that will do the compilation:

```Makefile
hello.bpf.o: %.o: %.c
   clang \
       -target bpf \
       -I/usr/include/$(shell uname -m)-linux-gnu \
       -g \
       -O2 -c $< -o $@
```

This generates an object file called hello.bpf.o from the source code in hello.bpf.c. The -g flag is optional here,3 but it generates debug information so that you can see the source code alongside the bytecode when you inspect the object file. Letâ€™s inspect this object file to better understand the eBPF code it contains.
